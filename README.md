# Azure Entra Security Assessment Tool

A comprehensive PowerShell-based security assessment tool for Azure Entra (formerly Azure AD) tenants. This tool analyzes various security settings, policies, and configurations to provide a detailed health report on your organization's identity and access management security posture.

## üîç What It Analyzes

The tool performs comprehensive security assessments across multiple areas:

### **Security Policies & Controls**
- **Security Defaults** - Baseline security enablement status
- **Conditional Access Policies** - MFA enforcement, device compliance, policy coverage
- **Password Policies** - Authentication method policies and password protection
- **Identity Protection** - Risk users, risk events, and threat detection

### **Access Management**
- **Privileged Role Assignments** - Admin role membership and distribution
- **Guest User Settings** - External collaboration security controls
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** - MFA adoption rates and configuration

### **Compliance & Governance**
- **Device Management** - Compliance policy enforcement
- **Application Permissions** - App registration security
- **Directory Settings** - Tenant-wide security configurations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **1. Setup Requirements**
First, run the setup script to install required PowerShell modules:

```powershell
# Run as Administrator (recommended) or Current User
.\setup-requirements.ps1
```

### **2. Run Security Assessment**
Execute the main assessment script:

```powershell
# Basic assessment with HTML report
.\Azure-Entra-Security-Assessment.ps1

# Detailed output with custom report location
.\Azure-Entra-Security-Assessment.ps1 -OutputPath ".\MyTenant-Security-Report.html" -DetailedOutput
```

### **3. Interactive Authentication**
The tool uses **device authentication** for secure, interactive login:
- No app registration required
- Uses your existing Azure credentials
- Supports MFA and conditional access policies
- Minimal permissions requested (read-only access)

```

### **Detailed Console Output**
```powershell
.\Azure-Entra-Security-Assessment.ps1 -DetailedOutput
```

### **Scheduled Assessments**
Create a scheduled task for regular security assessments:

```powershell
# Example: Weekly security assessment
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "PowerShell.exe" -Argument "-File 'C:\Scripts\Azure-Entra-Security-Assessment.ps1'"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -DaysOfWeek Monday -At 6AM
Register-ScheduledTask -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -TaskName "Weekly Azure Security Assessment"
```

## üîç Understanding Results

### **Critical Issues** üî¥
- No MFA enforcement
- Overprivileged accounts
- Disabled security features
- High-risk users unaddressed

### **High Priority** üü£
- Weak conditional access coverage
- Excessive guest permissions
- Missing device compliance
- Unmonitored privileged roles

### **Medium Priority** üü°
- Suboptimal policy configuration
- Limited security monitoring
- Governance improvements needed

### **Good Practices** üü¢
- Proper MFA implementation
- Well-configured conditional access
- Appropriate role assignments
- Active threat monitoring

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Module Installation Fails**
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
Install-Module -Name Az -Force -AllowClobber
```

**Authentication Issues**
- Ensure you have appropriate Azure AD permissions
- Check if conditional access policies block the connection
- Verify network connectivity to Azure services

**Graph API Errors**
- Some features require Azure AD Premium licenses
- Check if the requesting account has sufficient permissions
- Verify tenant settings allow the requested operations

### **Corporate Network Considerations**
```powershell
# Configure proxy if needed
[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials
```

## üìã Best Practices

### **Regular Assessments**
- Run monthly security assessments
- Compare results over time
- Track improvement progress
- Document remediation efforts

### **Stakeholder Reporting**
